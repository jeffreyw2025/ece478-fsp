# Financial Signal Processing PSet 2: Portfolio Analysis
Our objective is to analyze returns, risks, and market correlations for a set of 10
stocks from the S&P 500, as well as two subsets of 5 stocks each associated
with a particular sector. For my analysis, I selected the following technology stocks:
- AAPL (Apple)
- CSCO (Cisco)
- INTC (Intel)
- QCOM (Qualcomm)
- IBM (IBM)
and the following five health stocks:
- CI (Cigna)
- CVS (CVS Health)
- DGX (Quest Diagnostics)
- MRNA (Moderna)
- RMD (ResMed)

Data was acquired using yfinance and the dataack.py script and collected as a .csv. 
The analysis and plotting was performed on the generated .csv in the analysis.py script.
We note that, over the course of an entire year, that the tech stocks overall increased
in value and that the health stocks decreased in value.
